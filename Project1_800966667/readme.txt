For improving the performance of Quicksort we have introduced Insertion sort for number of elements less than 10.  
Description of Program:  
1. I have read a comma separated sequence of numbers from input file and added it to an array of sie 100000 
2. The CUTOFF for Insertion sort is 10 This cutoff gives the optimum number of key comparisons for variety of input sequences. 
3. The output of sorted sequence is written into a text file with comma separated values.
