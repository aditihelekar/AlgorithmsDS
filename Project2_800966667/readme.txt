This is a program to process a directed graph as follows:  
1. Read in the number of vertices V and the number of edges E of the graph followed by its E edges, each in the form u, v, w where 1 <= u, v <= V & w > 0 representing a direct edge <u, v> with weight w. 
2. Set up and print the adjacency matrix representation of the Graph. 
3. Determine whether the graph is a dag. If it is a dag, print a topological order. 
4. Find a shortest path tree from vertex 1. Print the adjacency matrix representation of the tree.
